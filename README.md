**🗓 Day 1: Linked List (Singly, Doubly & Circular)**  
**Date: 2 January 2026**

🔹 Topics Covered

Singly Linked List  
- Understood node structure with data and next reference  

Doubly Linked List  
- Used previous and next references for traversal and updates  

Circular Linked List  
- Implemented circular traversal using `tail.next = head`  

Algorithmic Thinking  
- Applied traversal-based logic  
- Compared node values and maintained counters  
- Designed efficient solutions using linked list properties  

✅ Practice Summary

Solved **9 Linked List–based programs** covering Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List  
- Student Record Management System  
- Inventory Management System  
- Social Media Friend Connections  

Doubly Linked List  
- Movie Management System  
- Library Management System  
- Undo/Redo Functionality for Text Editor  

Circular Linked List  
- Task Scheduler  
- Online Ticket Reservation System  
- Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm
