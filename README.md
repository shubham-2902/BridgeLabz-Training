# Week 4 – Java Collections & Streams

---

## 📅 Day 1: Introduction to Generics  
**Date:** 9 January 2026  

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- Introduction to Generics  
- Type Parameters  
- Generic Classes  
- Generic Methods  
- Bounded Type Parameters  
- Wildcards  

Focus was on **Java Generics**, which help in writing **reusable, type-safe, and cleaner code**.

### Why Generics?
- Prevents ClassCastException  
- Eliminates the need for explicit type casting  
- Promotes code reusability  
- Improves readability and maintainability  

### 🔹 Questions Practice
Worked on multiple problem statements based on Generics:
- Smart Warehouse Management System  
- Dynamic Online Marketplace  
- Multi-Level University Course Management System  
- Personalized Meal Plan Generator  
- AI-Driven Resume Screening System

- TreeMap → sorted by price  

**Banking System**
- HashMap → customer accounts  
- TreeMap → customers sorted by balance  
- Queue → withdrawal requests  

**Hospital Triage System**
- PriorityQueue → patients treated based on severity  

**Insurance Policy Management System**
- HashMap → store policies using policy numbers as keys  
- LinkedHashMap → maintain insertion order  
- TreeMap → store policies sorted by expiry date

- ByteArrayOutputStream  

**Use Case:** In-memory processing and image manipulation.

### Buffered Streams  
Enhance performance by minimizing I/O operations.

- BufferedInputStream  
- BufferedOutputStream  
- BufferedReader  
- BufferedWriter  

### Reader and Writer Streams  
Handle character data with encoding support.

- FileReader  
- FileWriter
