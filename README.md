- Implemented getters and setters with validation.
- Designed immutable classes where applicable.

### Polymorphism
- Leveraged interfaces for flexible behavior.

- Avoided unnecessary type casting.

### Interfaces
- Defined clear contracts for shared functionality.
- Implemented multiple interfaces when needed.
- Preferred composition over inheritance.
